How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The DriverPass was a project that worked to design a website for students to use to prepare to pass their drivers test. I used the clients needs to create something that satisfied the requirements so the student could choose packages, take classes, practice tests, and meet with a driver. I designed what needed to be done well, but had a hard time portraying it in the diagrams and would like to work on that. I took the user's needs and made them into my design by drawing out what needed to happen and the relationship between everything and how it would work. In the future I will continue to use psuedocode, diagrams, and pictures to lay out what needs to be done.
